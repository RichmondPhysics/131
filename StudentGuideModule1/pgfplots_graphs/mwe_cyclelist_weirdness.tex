% If I end with a comma after "red", it interprets it as if there is a second list item which is empty,
% Which means that it uses the default settings for every other plot, making every second plot black.
% Therefore, I must never end a list with a comma.
% This seems like a bug, since in other lists of options in pgfplots, I CAN put a comma on the last item.
\pgfplotscreateplotcyclelist{mycycle1}{
	red
}

% If I want a cycle with ONLY one item (all plots the same), but specifying two different attributes, 
% it appears I'm screwed no matter what I do.  
% If I DO put a comma at the end of the line, then it interprets as if there's an empty second item in the list,
% making every other line black and thin.
% But if I DON't put a comma at the end of the line, it ignores the braces around the two entries,
% alternating between "blue and thin" and "black and thick"
\pgfplotscreateplotcyclelist{mycycle2}{
	{blue,  line width = 2pt},
}

% The only solution I can find is that whenever I want a plot cycle list with one entry but several attributes,
% I need to manually repeat the entire entry.  And I must not put a comma after the second time.

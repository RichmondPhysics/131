\textbf{Objectives }

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item To understand the relationship between forces applied to an object and its motions. 
\item To find a mathematical relationship between the force applied to an object and its acceleration.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Overview }

In the previous labs, you have used a motion detector to display position-time,
velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs of the motion of different objects.
You were not concerned about how you got the objects to move, i.e., what forces
(pushes or pulls) acted on the objects. From your experiences, you know that
force and motion are related in some way. To start your bicycle moving, you
must apply a force to the pedal. To start up your car, you must step on the
gas pedal to get the engine to apply a force to the road through the tires.

But exactly how is force related to the quantities you used in the previous
unit to describe motion: position, velocity and acceleration? In this unit you
will pay attention to forces and how they affect motion. 
%You will apply forces
%to a cart, and observe the nature of its resulting motion graphically with a
%motion detector.

\medskip
\textbf{Apparatus} 

\begin{itemize} [nosep]
\item Force probe and variety of hanging masses 
\item CS2000 compact scale (for measuring mass)
\item Low friction pulley and string 
\item Motion detector 
\item Dynamics cart and track 
\item Pasco 550 Interface and \textit{Capstone} software (\filename{V\_A\_F\_Graphs.cap} experiment file)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Measuring Forces} 

In this investigation you will use a force probe (also called a force sensor) to measure forces. The force probe puts out a voltage signal proportional to the force applied to the arm of the probe. Physicists have defined a standard unit of force called the newton, abbreviated N. For your work on forces and the motions they cause, it will be more convenient to have the force probe read directly in newtons rather than voltage. Before the force probe is used it must be calibrated. Before calibrating the force probe, open the 
\filename{V\_A\_F\_Graphs.cap} file in the \filename{\coursefolder} folder.
To calibrate the force probe, see \textit{Calibrating Force Sensors} in \textbf{Appendix \ref{capstone}: Capstone}.

%\pagebreak[2]
%\textbf{Motion and Force} 
%
%Now you can use the force probe to apply measured amounts of force to an object.
%You can also use the motion detector, as in the previous units, to examine the
%motion of the object. In this way you will be able to establish the relationship
%between motion and force.
%\vspace{10mm}

\textbf{Activity 1: Pushing and Pulling a Cart} 

In this activity you will move a cart by pushing and pulling it with your hand.
You will measure the force, velocity and acceleration. 
%Then you will be able
%to look for relationships between the applied force and the motion quantities,
%to see which is (are) related to force.

(b) Suppose you grasp the hook on the force probe and move the cart forwards
and backwards in front of the motion detector. Will either the
velocity or the acceleration graph will look like the force graph? 
%Is either of these motion quantities related to force? 
%That is to say, if you apply a
%changing force to the cart, will the velocity or acceleration change in the
%same way as the force?

(c) To test your predictions, click the \textbf{Record} button, grasp the
hook on the force probe and push and pull the cart back and forth 3 or 4 times. Be sure that
the cart never gets closer than 0.15 m away from the detector and be careful
of the wires. Repeat until you get a good run, and adjust the sampling rate 
and scale of the axes if necessary. Sketch your graphs on the axes that follow.

\textbf{Activity 2: Speeding Up }

You have seen in the previous activity that force and acceleration seem to be
related. But just what is the relationship between force and acceleration? 

(a) Suppose you have a cart with very little friction, and that you pull this
cart with a constant force as shown below on the force-time graph. Predict with sketches on
the axes below the velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs of the cart's motion.

\textit{vs.}~time graphs for the cart.

(c) Test your predictions. Set up the pulley, cart, string, motion detector
and force probe as shown in the figure above. 
The cart should be the same mass as before. 
Place masses of 100 g, 50 g, and two 20-g masses on the top of the cart.
You will use these masses to create an applied force on the cart by attaching
them to the string, running the string over the pulley, and letting gravity do
the work.
The masses you hang from the string also contribute to the total mass of the 
object (cart+masses) being accelerated.
We sit them on the cart until they are used so the total mass is the same for all
the trials.

At the start of each trial press the ``TARE'' button on the side of the force sensor 
when there is no applied force on the hook.
This step resets the device so you get a proper reading.
Now take one of those masses, the 50-g one, from the cart and 
hang it from the end of the string. 
Start the data acquisition.
Release the cart when you hear the clicks of the motion detector. Be sure that
there is enough slack in the force probe cables to complete the motion and catch
the cart before it crashes into the pulley. Repeat with this configuration of the
masses until you get good graphs
in which the cart is seen by the motion detector over the entire motion. Sketch
the actual velocity, acceleration and force graphs for the motion of interest
on the axes below and indicate the scale on the axes. Draw smooth graphs; don't
worry about small bumps.

the average force and the average acceleration
and record them below. Find the mean values only during the time interval when
the force and acceleration are nearly constant. See \textbf{Appendix \ref{capstone}} for details on
the use of the \textbf Highlight and  \textbf{Statistics} functions of Capstone.
\answerspace{20mm}

\textbf{Activity 3: Acceleration from Different Forces }

In the previous activity you have examined the motion of a cart with a constant
force applied to it. But, what is the relationship between acceleration and
force? If you apply a larger force to the same cart (same mass as before) how
will the acceleration change? In this activity you will try to answer these
questions by applying a different force to the cart, and measuring the corresponding
acceleration. 

(a) Suppose you pulled the cart with a force about twice as large as before.
What would happen to the acceleration of the cart? Explain.
\answerspace{20mm}

\pagebreak[3]
(b) Test your prediction by replacing the 50-g mass with the 100-g mass on the cart, 
returning the 50-g mass to the cart, and taring the force sensor with no force acting on the hook.
Now create graphs of the motion as before. 
Repeat until you have a good run. Sketch the
results on the axes that follow. Don't forget to put the scale on the axes.

\textbf{Activity 4: The Relationship Between Acceleration and Force }

If you accelerate the same cart (same mass) with different forces, you can 
plot a graph of force \textit{vs.}~acceleration.
You can then find the mathematical relationship between acceleration and force. 

(a) Accelerate the cart with a force roughly midway between the other two forces
tried. Use a hanging mass about midway between those used in the last two activities.
Record the mass below.
\answerspace{10mm}

(b) Graph velocity, acceleration and force. Sketch the graphs on the axes in
Activity 3 using dashed lines.

(c) Find the mean acceleration and force, as before, and record the values in
the table below (in the Activity 4 line). Also, enter the values from the previous 
two activities in the table.
Use different combinations of the
masses to get other applied forces and enter the results in the table.

(d) Using \textit{Excel}, plot the average force applied to the cart as a function of the average acceleration of the cart by fitting the data with a linear function. Include a fourth data point (0,0) (since zero force means 0 acceleration). Label and print the graph showing the best fit, and add it to this unit.

(e) Does there appear to be a simple mathematical relationship between the acceleration of a cart (with fixed mass) and the force applied to the cart (measured by the force probe mounted on the cart)? Write down the equation you found and describe the mathematical relationship in words.  What is the slope of the graph?
\answerspace{20mm}

(f) Use the LINEST function in \textit{Excel} (see \textbf{Appendix \ref{excel}: Excel}) to determine the uncertainty in mass of the cart/force sensor combination based on your data points.  Write your result as \textit{Mass} = $m$ \( \pm \ \Delta  m\). Be sure and include proper units.

(g) Does your measurement of $m$ from Activity 1 fall within the range indicated in (f) above? If not, what are some possible sources of systematic error?

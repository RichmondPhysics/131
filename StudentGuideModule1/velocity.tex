\textbf{Objectives }

\begin{itemize}
\item To acquire an intuitive understanding of speed and velocity in one dimension. 
\item To learn how to relate graphs of velocity vs. time to the motions they represent.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Introduction} 

You have already plotted your position as a function of time. Another way to
represent your motion during an interval of time is with a graph which describes
how fast and in what direction you are moving from moment to moment. How fast
you move is known as your speed. It is the rate of change of position with respect
to time. Velocity is a quantity which takes into account your speed and the
direction you are moving. Thus, when you examine the motion of an object moving
along a line, its velocity can be positive or negative depending
on whether the object is moving in the positive or negative direction.

Graphs of velocity over time are more challenging to create and interpret than
those for position. A good way to learn to interpret them is to create and examine velocity vs. time graphs of your own body motions, as you will do in the next few activities.

\textbf{Apparatus}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Science Workshop 750 Interface}
\item Ultrasonic motion detector
\item \textit{Data Studio} software (Velocity Graphs aplication)
\item Wooden board
\end{itemize}

To make the graphs in the following activities, use the \textbf{Velocity Graphs} application by going to \textbf{Start} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Programs} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Physics Applications} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{131 Workshop} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Velocity Graphs}. Click \textbf{Start} to begin, \textbf{Stop} to end a data run.

\textbf{Activity 1: Making Velocity vs. Time Graphs} 

(a) Make a velocity graph by walking away from the detector slowly and steadily.
Try again until you get a graph you're satisfied with and then sketch your result
on the graph that follows. (We suggest you draw smooth patterns by ignoring
smaller bumps that are mostly due to your steps.)

\vspace{0.3cm}

(b) Make a velocity graph, walking away from the detector steadily at a medium
speed. Sketch your graph below.

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig1.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

(c) Make a velocity graph, walking toward the detector slowly and steadily.
Sketch your graph below.

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig1.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

(d) What is the most important difference between the graph made by slowly walking
away from the detector and the one made by walking away more quickly? 
\vspace{20mm}

(e) How are the velocity vs. time graphs different for motion away and motion
toward the detector?
\vspace{20mm}

\textbf{Activity 2: Predicting a Velocity vs. Time Graph }

Suppose you were to undergo the following sequence of motions: (1) walk away
from the detector slowly and steadily for 6 seconds, (2) stand still for 6 seconds,
(3) walk toward the detector steadily about twice as fast as before.

(a) Use a dashed line in the graph that follows to record your prediction of
the shape of the velocity graph that will result from the motion described above.

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig2.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

(b) Compare predictions with your partner(s) and see if you can all agree. Use
a solid line to sketch your group prediction in the graph above.

(c) Adjust the sampling time to 15 s and then test your prediction. Repeat your
motion until you are confident that it matches the description in words and
then draw the actual graph on the axes below. Be sure the 6-second stop shows
clearly.

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig2.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

(d) Did your prediction match your real motion? If not, what misunderstanding
of what elements of the graph did you have?
\vspace{20mm}

\textbf{Velocity Vectors} 

The two ideas of speed and direction can be combined and represented by vectors.
A velocity vector is represented by an arrow pointing in the direction of motion.
The length of the arrow is drawn proportional to the speed; the longer the arrow,
the larger the speed. If you are moving toward the right, your velocity vector
can be represented by the arrow shown below.

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig3.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

If you were moving twice as fast toward the right, the arrow representing your
velocity vector would look like:

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig4.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

while moving twice as fast toward the left would be represented by the following
arrow:

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig5.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

What is the relationship between a one-dimensional velocity vector and the sign
of velocity? This depends on the way you choose to set the positive $x$-axis.

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig6.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

In both diagrams the top vectors represent velocity toward the right. In the
left diagram, the $x$-axis has been drawn so that the positive $x$-direction is
toward the right. Thus the top arrow represents positive velocity. However,
in the right diagram, the positive $x$-direction is toward the left. Thus the
top arrow represents negative velocity. Likewise, in both diagrams the bottom
arrows represent velocity toward the left. In the left diagram this is negative
velocity, and in the right diagram it is positive velocity.

\textbf{Activity 3: Sketching Velocity Vectors} 

Sketch below velocity vectors representing the three parts of the motion described
in the prediction you made in Activity 2.

(a)Walking slowly away from the detector:

(b) Standing still:

(c) Walking rapidly toward the detector:

\textbf{Activity 4: Matching a Velocity Graph} 

(a) Describe how you think you will have to move in order to match the velocity
graph shown below.

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{velocity_fig7.eps} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

\vspace{20mm}
(b) Move in such a way that you can reproduce the graph shown. You may have
to practice a number of times to get the movements right. Work as a team and
plan your movements. Get the times right. Get the velocities right. You and
each person in your group should take a turn. Then sketch your group's best
match on the above graph.

(c) Describe how you moved to match each part of the graph.
\vspace{20mm}

(d) Is it possible for an object to move so that it produces an absolutely vertical
line on a velocity-time graph? Explain.
\vspace{20mm}

(e) Did you run into the motion detector on your return trip? If so, why did
this happen? How did you solve the problem? Does a velocity graph tell you where
to start? Explain.

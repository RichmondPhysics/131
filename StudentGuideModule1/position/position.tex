\textbf{Introduction} 

The focus of this unit on kinematics is to be able to describe your position
as a function of time using words and graphs. You will use a wireless motion sensor
connected to a computer to learn to describe one-dimensional motion.

The motion sensor sends out a series of sound pulses that are of
too high a frequency to hear (ultrasonic). These pulses reflect from objects in the vicinity
of the motion sensor and some of the sound energy returns to the sensor.
The computer is able to record the time it takes for reflected sound waves to
return to the sensor and then, by knowing the speed of sound in air, figure
out how far away the reflecting object is. There are several things to watch
out for when using a motion sensor. (1) Do not get closer than 0.15 meters
from the sensor because it cannot record reflected pulses which come back
too soon. (2) The ultrasonic waves come out in a cone of about 15\( ^{\circ } \).
It will see the closest object. Be sure there is a clear path between the object
whose motion you want to track and the motion sensor. (3) The motion sensor
is very sensitive and will detect slight motions. You can try to glide smoothly
along the floor, but don't be surprised to see small bumps in velocity graphs.
(4) Some objects like bulky sweaters are good sound absorbers and may not be
``seen'' well by a motion sensor. Hold a wooden board in front of you when 
doing the activities below so the motion sensor can ``see'' a smooth surface.

\textbf{Position \textit{vs.}~Time Graphs of Your Motion }

The purpose of this unit is to learn how to relate graphs of position as a function
of time to the motions they represent. How does a position \textit{vs.}~time graph look
when you move slowly? Quickly? What happens when you move toward the motion
sensor? Away? After completing the next few activities, you should be able
to look at a position \textit{vs.}~time graph and describe the motion of the object.
You should also be able to look at the motion of an object and sketch a graph
representing that motion.

Note that the motion sensor measures the distance of an object from the sensor,
and that the motion sensor is located at the origin of each graph. It is common
to refer to the distance of an object from some origin as the position of the
object. Therefore, it is better to refer to these graphs as position \textit{vs.}~time
graphs than distance \textit{vs.}~time graphs.

You will use the \textit{Capstone} software to do the following activities.
Launch the \filename{P\_Graphs.cap} file by going to the \filename{\coursefolder} folder on the desktop. Next, turn the sensor on by pressing the power button located on its side (when on, the status LED will blink). In \textit{Capstone}, select \textbf{Hardware Setup} in the \textbf{Tools} palette. In \textbf{Hardware Setup}, the sensors are ordered by
proximity to the device. To connect a sensor to the computer via Bluetooth, select the correct address that matches the Device ID number (XXX-XXX) found on the motion sensor at your station.  
 
To start a data run, click the \textbf{Record} button in the \textbf{Controls} palette. To stop a data run, click the \textbf{Stop} button in the \textbf{Controls} palette. After a data run, the graph can be expanded by clicking on the \textbf{Scale to Fit} button in the upper left corner of the Graph window. Multiple data sets can be displayed on the same graph. Data
can be removed from the graph by opening the \textbf{Delete Last Run} menu on the \textbf{Controls} palette and selecting \textbf{Delete All Runs} or \textbf{Delete Run \#X}. When you are finished with the activities, choose \textbf{Exit} from the \textbf{File} menu and do not save this activity.

Before you begin the activities, you should mark a position scale on the floor.
To do this, position one person at approximately 1 meter in front of the motion
sensor and take data for 1 second. The computer will display a horizontal
line showing the position measured by the sensor. The person standing in front
of the sensor should then adjust their position and the procedure repeated
until the 1 meter position is established. Mark the 1 meter position on the
floor with a piece of masking tape and then mark the 2, 3 and 4 meter positions
using the 2 meter stick.

\textbf{Activity 1: Making Position \textit{vs.}~Time Graphs }

Make position-time graphs for the following motions and sketch the graph you
observe in each case:

(a) Starting at 0.5 m, walk away from the origin (i.e., the motion sensor) slowly
and steadily.

	height = {1.4in}, width = {2.0in},
	xlabel={Time},
	ylabel={Position},
	]
\end{lab_axis}

(b) Walk away from the origin medium-fast and steadily.

and the one made by walking away more quickly.

(e) Describe the difference between the graph made by walking toward and the
one made walking away from the origin.

\textbf{Activity 2: Predicting a Position \textit{vs.}~Time Graph} 

(a) Suppose you were to start 1.0~m in front of the motion sensor and walk away
slowly and steadily for 4 seconds, stop for 4 seconds, and then walk toward
the sensor quickly. Sketch your prediction on the axes below using a dashed
line.

%\vspace{0.3cm}
%{\par\centering \includegraphics{position/position_fig2.eps} \par}
%\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{lab_axis}*[lab_grid,
	xlabel={Time (s)},
	ylabel={Position (m)},
	xmin=0, xmax=15,
	ymin=0, ymax=3,
	xtick distance = 3,
%	ytick distance = 1,
	minor y tick num=1,
	minor x tick num=2,
	]
\end{lab_axis}

(b) Test your prediction by moving in the way described and making a graph of
your motion with the motion sensor. Sketch the trace of your actual motion
on the above graph with a solid line. 

(c) Is your prediction the same as the final result? If not, describe how you
would move to make a graph that looks like your prediction.

shown above.

(b) Move to match the above graph on the computer screen. You may try a number
of times. It helps to work as a team. Get the times right. Get the positions
right. Do this for yourself. (Each person in your group should do their own match. You will not learn very much by just watching!)

(c) What was the difference in the way you moved to produce the two differently
sloped parts of the graph you just matched?

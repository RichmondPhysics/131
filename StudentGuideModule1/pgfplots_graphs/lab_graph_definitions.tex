% The commmand below makes vertical alignment marks through all graphs in a groupplot.
% (Restricted to only a single column, but multiple rows.  The rows can be 1 though.)
%
% How to call:
% \makegroupverticlas[rows]{x1,x2,x3...}{xmin}{xmax}
% rows is assumed to be 2 if not specified.  xmin and xmax are the min and max values of the axis.
% Oh, and it won't work if you define a name for the group; it must remain the default "group".
%
% This was a giant pain to get to work.  
% The problem seems to be that INSIDE the groupplot environment, tikz knows about xmin and xmax
% (since it can get it from \pgfkeysvalueof{/pgfplots/xmin) but does not know about the top and bottom
% of the whole group; only of a single axis.
% But OUTSIDE the grouplot environment, tikz knows about the top and bottom of the group
% (from group c1r1.north west, for instance), but does not know about the scale of the x axis.
% Or at least I couldn't figure out how to get it to know about the x axis.  Maybe someone else can.
% If so, it would be a nice improvement to NOT have to pass it xmin and xmax, or even the number of
% rows, for that matter.

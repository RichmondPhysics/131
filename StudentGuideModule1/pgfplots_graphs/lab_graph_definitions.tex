% This file loads all packages and makes all definitions used for making various graphs,
% using Tikz and pgfplots.  It was developed in July-August 2019 by Matt Trawick.
% The goal is to pre-define several basic types of graphs used in our manuals (plain axes
% with qualitative graphs, or empty grids with scales, etc.) that could be easily used and
% tweaked throughout the manual, for stylistic uniformity.
% These could gradually (or not so gradually) replace the hodge-podge of .eps files
% generated from difference sources that are currently used in the manuals.

% how things work.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Below, set several style choices used throughout the manual.
\tikzset{every picture/.style={font=\sffamily}}

\pgfplotsset{
  tick label style = {font=\sansmath\sffamily},
%  every axis label = {font=\sansmath\sffamily},
%  legend style = {font=\sffamily},
%  label style = {font=\sffamily}
	samples = 200,
	height = {2in}, width = {2in},
	every axis/.append style={line width=0.8pt}, %default appears to be about 0.4pt
	tick style={black, line width=0.8pt}, %default appears to be gray and about 0.4pt
}


% This pre-defines a "cycle" of colors and styles that can be used for successive plots added to an axis.
% In this case the "cycle" effectively has only one entry, so all plots look the same.
% But note that in order to achieve that effect, I need to repeat the entry, once with a comma, and once
% without a comma.  See the file mwe_cyclelist_weirdness.tex for details.
\pgfplotscreateplotcyclelist{lab_solid}{
	{black, line width = 2pt, mark=none},
	{black, line width = 2pt, mark=none}
	% Note: by my eye, "thick"=0.8 pt, "very thick" = 1.2 pt, "ultra thick" = 1.6 pt
}

% This style can be called for a plot (addplot [path_leg] ...).  It puts an arrow head in the middle of the path.
\pgfplotsset{path_leg/.style={
	line width=1.5pt, 
	postaction={decorate, decoration={markings,

% This part predefines several named styles ("lab_noticks_1quad" for a single-quadrant set of blank axes, etc.)
% that can be called for various graphs used throughout the manual.
% Each option within the defined style can be overridden individually as needed, or
% additional options added. For instance,
% 		\begin{lab_axis}[lab_noticks_2quads,
% 			ymin = -0.5,
% 			....
%
% These "styles" are really just lists of options, and can be combined if needed, as in 
% 		\begin{lab_axis}[lab_noticks_2quads,
%			plus_minus_zero_labels
% 			....

% single quadrant:
\pgfplotsset{lab_noticks_1quad/.style={
	scale only axis=true,
	cycle list name = lab_solid,
	% every axis plot/.append style={very thick},
	% I now specify thickness in the lab_solid cycle definition, so previous line is not needed.

	axis x line={left, x axis line style={->}}, % solid line with no arrow.
	axis y line={left, y axis line style={->}},
	xmin=0, xmax=1,
	ymin=0, ymax=1, %Although there are no ticks, this seems to be needed to make the ticks disappear.
	tick style={xtick=\empty,ytick=\empty}

% two quadrants (I and IV):

%new way:

%three dimension (x-y-z):
\pgfplotsset{lab_noticks_3axes/.style={
	scale only axis=true,
	cycle list name = lab_solid,
	every axis plot/.append style={domain=0.85*\pgfkeysvalueof{/pgfplots/xmin} :

\pgfplotsset{lab_noticks_1axis/.style={
	cycle list name = lab_solid,

}}

\pgfplotsset{lab_grid/.style={
	scale only axis=true,
	cycle list name = lab_solid,
	% every axis plot/.append style={ultra thick},
	% Interestingly, previous line does NOT override thickness in lab_solid

% This option puts the labels next to the ends of the axes, rotated right-side up.
\pgfplotsset{algebraic_labels/.append style={
	xlabel style={at=(current axis.right of origin), anchor=north east},
	ylabel style={at=(ticklabel* cs:1.0), rotate=-90, anchor=north east},
}}

% Note that the following three options, y0_line, x0_line, and ylabel_align, achieve their results by adding
% "Extra ticks" on the y-axis, with labels that are either missing completely or "hidden".

% This option adds a darker horizontal line at y=0.  It is now standard on lab_grid style graphs.
% You can cancel this option by using
%			extra y ticks={},
% as needed, but be sure to do so BEFORE using the ylabel_align option, as it will cancel that too.
\pgfplotsset{y0_line/.style={
	extra y ticks={0},
	extra y tick labels = {},
	extra y tick style={
		major grid style={black, line width=0.8pt},
		major tick length=0pt,
		},
}}

% This option adds a darker vertical line at x=0.  It is now standard on lab_grid style graphs.
% You can cancel this option by using
%			extra x ticks={},
% as needed.
\pgfplotsset{x0_line/.style={
	extra x ticks={0},
	extra x tick style={
		major grid style={black, line width=0.8pt},
		major tick length=0pt,
		xticklabels = {},
		},
}}

% In a groupplot, the y labels can be misaligned if one graph has "longer" tick lables, such as ones that include
% a negative sign.  This command bumps the y label of the current to the left, to match the alignment of the
% y label of the other graph.  To tell it how much to move it over, you need to give it the longest tick label text 
% of the other graph as an argument.  Example: 
% 		ylabel_align={-10}
\pgfplotsset{ylabel_align/.style={
	extra y ticks={\pgfkeysvalueof{/pgfplots/ymin}},
	extra y tick labels={\phantom{$#1$}},
 	extra y tick style={
		major tick length=0pt,
		},
}}

% This version of the function does the same as above, but uses a length as the argument:
%		ylabel_align_length{0.5in}
% Because it does not define a phantom label, it is more robust and plays nicely with y0_line.
% Eventually I should change this to use actual text for the argument, using something like the
% widthof function, but there seem to be technical issues getting that to work.
\pgfplotsset{ylabel_align_length/.style={
	every axis y label/.style={
		at={(0,0.5)}, % do I need this line?
		xshift=-#1, 
		rotate=90, % do I need this line?
}}}  


% Use this to add y axis labels +, -, and 0 to graphs, presumably to lab_noticks_2quads style graphs.
\pgfplotsset{plus_minus_zero_labels/.style={
	extra y tick style={major tick length=0pt},
	extra y ticks = {-0.8, 0, 0.8},
	extra y tick labels = {\scriptsize{$-$},0,\scriptsize{$+$}},
}}


% The commmand below makes vertical alignment marks through all graphs in a groupplot.
% (Restricted to only a single column, but multiple rows.  The number of rows can be "1" though.)
%
% How to call:
% 		\makegroupverticlas[rows]{x1,x2,x3...}{xmin}{xmax}
% rows is assumed to be 2 if not specified.  xmin and xmax are the min and max values of the axis.
% Oh, and it won't work if you define a name for the group; it must remain the default "group".
%
% This was a giant pain to get to work.  
% The problem seems to be that INSIDE the groupplot environment, tikz knows about xmin and xmax
% (since it can get it from \pgfkeysvalueof{/pgfplots/xmin} ) but does not know about the top and bottom
% of the whole group; only of a single axis.
% But OUTSIDE the grouplot environment, tikz knows about the top and bottom of the group
% (from group c1r1.north west, for instance), but does not know about the scale of the x axis.
% Or at least I couldn't figure out how to get it to know about the x axis.  Maybe someone else can.
% If so, it would be a nice improvement to NOT have to pass it xmin and xmax, or even the number of
% rows, for that matter. 
\NewDocumentCommand \makegroupverticals {o m m m} {
	\coordinate (TL) at (group c1r1.north west); % top left
      \IfNoValueTF  {#2} {%If no lastrow given, assume two rows
		\coordinate (BR) at (group c1r3.south east); % bottom right

}

% Here's an older version of makegroupverticals.

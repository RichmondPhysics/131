\section{Galilean Relativity Exercises}

\instructornote{%
By Matt Trawick, 2019.  Time: 20 minutes

This lab assumes that students have already seen the Galilean transformations, for instance as developed at the end of the lab ``Galilean Relativity.''

This lab is just practice making a spacetime graph, and transforming coordinates according to the Galilean transformations.  It introduces a Mathematica simulation to help build some intuition for transformations between reference frames.  The same Mathematica file also contains a nearly identical simulation that performs Lorentz Transformations, but this lab doesn't use it yet.

\textbf{Activity 1: Drawing Spacetime Graphs} 

A spacetime graph, also called a \textit{Minkowski diagram}, is just like a position vs. time graph, except that the axes are flipped.

\begin{enumerate}[labparts]

\item Suppose that you start at the origin and walk at a speed of 0.5~m/s to a vending machine located at $x=10$~m).  Once you are there, it takes you an additional 20 seconds to buy a candy bar.  You then return to your original starting place at a speed of 0.25~m/sec. On the axes below, draw a spacetime graph of the following situation.  This graph of your motion is called your ``worldline.''

\begin{lab_axis}*[lab_grid,
	width=3in, height=3in,
	xlabel={Position (m)},
	ylabel={Time (s)},
	xmin=-40, xmax=40,
	ymin=0, ymax=80,
%	xtick distance = 4,
%	ytick distance = 2,
%	minor y tick num=1,
%	minor x tick num=1,
	]
\end{lab_axis}

\pagebreak[2]
\item There are four ``events'' that take place in the graph you just drew:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item You start walking at ($x=0$ m, $t=0$ s).
\item Your arrival at the machine at ($x=10$ m, $t=20$ s).
\item Your departure from the machine at ($x=10$ m, $t=40$ s).
\item Your arrival back where you started ($x=0$ m, $t=80$ s).
\end{itemize}
Use the Galilean transforms to transform the $x$ coordinates of each of those events into a reference frame that starts with you at the origin at time $t=0$ and moves at a constant velocity of $v=+0.5$~m/s throughout your journey.

\item On the axes below, draw your ``worldline'' for your round-trip journey as seen in the moving reference frame above.

\begin{lab_axis}*[lab_grid,
	width=3in, height=3in,
	xlabel={Position (m)},
	ylabel={Time (s)},
	xmin=-40, xmax=40,
	ymin=0, ymax=80,
%	xtick distance = 4,
%	ytick distance = 2,
%	minor y tick num=1,
%	minor x tick num=1,
	]
\end{lab_axis}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 2: Visualizing your graph with a computer} 

\begin{enumerate}[labparts]

\item Open the file \filename{minkowski\_events.nb}, which will open in Mathematica.  Type \button{Ctrl-A} to select everything, and type \button{Shift-Enter} to execute all of the lines you have selected.  Then scroll down to the first graph you see, titled ``Galilean Transformation''.    It shows a spacetime graph for a regular grid of events, shown as blue dots.  Two particular events are highlighted in green.  As you move the slider left and right, you can see how the events transform into reference frames of different speeds.  Go ahead, try it!

\item You can see the line of code above the graph that generates the two points at (5,1) and (3,2).  The code will look something like this:
\begin{align*}
&\texttt{ListPlot[{galilean[5, 1, v], galilean[3, 2, v]}, PlotStyle -> {PointSize[Large], Green}]}
\end{align*}


Edit these points, and add a third one, to show the last three points in your round-trip journey to the vending machine from part (a).  Divide both $x$ and $t$ by 10 to fit on the graph without having to rescale the axes.  When you are done editing, hit \button{Ctrl-Enter} to make the changes to the graph.

\item Move the slider to view the events in a reference frame with speed $v=0.5$.  Do the results match with your graph above?

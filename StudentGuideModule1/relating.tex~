\textbf{Objective }

To understand the relationship between position vs. time and velocity vs. time
graphs.

\textbf{Introduction} 

You have looked at position and velocity vs. time graphs separately. Since position
vs. time and velocity vs. time graphs are different ways to represent the same
motion, it ought to be possible to figure out the velocity at which someone
is moving by examining her/his position vs. time graph. Conversely, you ought
to be able to figure out how far someone has traveled (change in position) from
a velocity vs. time graph.

To explore how position vs. time and velocity vs. time graphs are related, go to \textbf{Start} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Programs} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Physics Applications} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{131 Workshop} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Position \& Velocity Graphs}. For some of the runs it may be necessary to adjust the time axis for one of the graphs so that the time scales are the same for the position and velocity graphs.

\textbf{Activity 1: Predicting Velocity Graphs from Position Graphs} 

(a) Carefully study the position graph shown below and predict the velocity
vs. time graph that would result from the motion. Using a dashed line, sketch
your prediction of the corresponding velocity vs. time graph on the velocity
axes.

(b) After each person in your group has sketched a prediction, test your prediction
by matching the position vs. time graph shown. When you have made a good duplicate
of the position graph, sketch your actual graph over the existing position vs.
time graph.
Use a solid line to draw the actual velocity graph on the same graph with
your prediction. (Do not erase your prediction).

(c) How would the position graph be different if you moved faster? Slower? 
\vspace{20mm}

(d) How would the velocity graph be different if you moved faster? Slower?

\textbf{Activity 2: Average Velocity Calculations} 

(a) Find your average velocity \underline{during the time you were moving} from your velocity graph in the previous activity. To do this, use the Smart Tool on the graph menu bar (sixth box along the top of the graph window) to determine the velocity at ten points on the \underline{left} part of the graph (the first 2.5 seconds). Record these ten values, then average them to get an estimate of the average velocity (for the time you were moving).

\vspace{5mm}

Average value of the velocity: \rule{1.0in}{0.1pt} m/s

Standard deviation: \rule{1.0in}{0.1pt} m/s     (This can be taken as an uncertainty.)

Average velocity with uncertainty: \rule{1.5in}{0.1pt} m/s
\vspace{10mm}

(b) Average velocity during a particular time interval can also be calculated
as the change in position divided by the change in time. (The change in position
is often called the displacement.) By definition, this is also the slope of
the position vs. time graph for that time period. Use the cursors on the position
vs. time graph to read the position and time coordinates for two typical points
while you were moving. (For a more accurate answer, use two points as far apart
as possible but still typical of the motion, \underline{and within the time 
interval over which} \underline{you took velocity readings in part (a)}.) 
Record the coordinates of the points below.
\vspace{10mm}

(c) Calculate the change in position (displacement) between the two points in
part (b). Also calculate the corresponding change in time (time interval). Divide
the change in position by the change in time to calculate the average velocity.
Show your calculations below.
\vspace{20mm}

(d) Is the average velocity positive or negative? Is this what you expected? 
\vspace{20mm}

(e) Does the average velocity you just calculated from the position graph agree
with the average velocity you estimated from the velocity graph? Do you expect
them to agree? How would you account for any differences?
\vspace{20mm}

\textbf{Activity 3: Finding Position from a Velocity Graph }

(a) Carefully study the velocity graph that follows. Using a dashed line, sketch your prediction of the corresponding position graph on the top set of axes.
(Assume that you started at the 1-meter mark.)

(b) After each person has sketched a prediction, do your group's best to duplicate the bottom (velocity vs. time) graph by walking. When you have made a good duplicate of the velocity vs. time graph, draw your actual result over the existing velocity vs. time graph. Use a solid line on the top graph to draw the actual position vs. time graph on the same axes with your prediction. Do not erase your prediction.

(c) How can you tell from a velocity vs. time graph that the moving object has
changed direction?
\vspace{10mm}

(d) What is the velocity at the moment the direction changes? 
\vspace{10mm}

(e) Is it possible to actually move your body (or an object) to make vertical
lines on a position vs. time graph? Why or why not? What would the velocity
be for a vertical section of a position vs. time graph? 
\vspace{10mm}

(f) How can you tell from a position vs. time graph that your motion is steady
(motion at a constant velocity)? 
\vspace{10mm}

(g) How can you tell from a velocity vs. time graph that your motion is steady
(constant velocity)? 
\vspace{10mm}

\textbf{Homework} 

1. Draw the velocity graphs for an object whose motion produced the position-time
graphs shown below on the left. Position is in meters and velocity in meters
per second. Note: Unlike most real objects, you can assume these objects can
change velocity so quickly that it looks instantaneous with this time scale.

2. Draw careful graphs below of position and velocity for a cart that (a) moves
away from the origin at a slow and steady (constant) velocity for the first
5 seconds; (b) moves away at a medium-fast, steady (constant) velocity for the
next 5 seconds; (c) stands still for the next 5 seconds; (d) moves toward the
origin at a slow and steady (constant) velocity for the next 5 seconds; (e)
stands still for the last 5 seconds.

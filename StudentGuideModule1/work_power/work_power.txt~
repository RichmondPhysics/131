The Concept of Physical Work
Suppose you are president of the Richmond Load 'n' Go Co.  A local college has three jobs
available and will allow you to choose which one you want before offering the other two jobs
to rival companies.  All three jobs pay the same amount of money.  Which one would you
choose for your crew?



           Figure 1: A description of jobs to bid on.

Activity 1: Choosing Your Job
Examine the descriptions of the jobs shown in Figure 1.  Which one would you be most
likely to choose?  Least likely to choose?  Explain the reasons for your answer.







You obviously want to do the least amount of work for the most money.  Before you
reconsider your answers later in this unit, you should do a series of activities to get a better
feel for what physicists mean by work and how the president of Load 'n' Go can make top
dollar.



         Figure 2: Doing physical work while "playing".

In everyday language we refer to doing work whenever we expend effort.  In order to get an
intuitive feel for how we might define work mathematically, you should experiment with
moving your textbook back and forth along a table top and a rougher surface such as a
carpeted floor.

Activity 2: This is Work!
(a) Pick a distance of a meter or so.  Sense how much effort it takes to push a heavy book
that distance.  How much more effort does it take to push it twice as far? 




(b) Pile another similar book on top of the original one and sense how much effort it takes to
push the two books through the distance you picked.  Comment below.




(c) From your study of sliding friction, what is the relationship between the mass of a sliding
object and the friction force it experiences?  On the basis of your experience with sliding
friction, estimate how much more force you have to apply to push two books compared to
one book.




(d) If  the "effort" it takes to move an object is associated with physical work, guess an
equation that can be used to define work mathematically when the force on an object and its
displacement (i.e., the distance it moves) lie along the same line.

In physics, work is not simply effort.  In fact, the physicist's definition of work is precise and
mathematical.  In order to have a full understanding of how work is defined in physics, we
need to consider its definition in a very simple situation and then enrich it later to include
more realistic situations.

A Simple Definition of Physical Work: If an object that is moving in a straight line
experiences a constant force in the direction of its motion during the time it is undergoing a
displacement, the work done by the external force , Fext, is defined as the product of the force
and the displacement of the object.
                         W = FextDx                    [Equation 1]

where W represents the work done by the external force, Fext is the magnitude of the force,
and Dx the displacement of the object.  Work done by a force is always positive!

What if the force of interest and the displacement are in the opposite direction?  For instance,
what about the work done against the force of sliding friction, Ff, when a block slides down
an inclined plane as a result of the gravitational force?  In this case we refer to work done
against a force.  This is given by 
                         Wagainst =   FfDx                    [Equation 2]

Work done against a force is always negative!

Activity 3: Applying the Physics Definition of Work
(a) Does effort necessarily result in physical work?  Suppose two guys are in an evenly match
tug of war.  They are obviously expending effort to pull on the rope, but according to the
definition of physical work, are they doing any physical work?  Explain.



(b) A wooden block with a mass of .30 kg is pushed along a sheet of ice that has no friction
with a constant external force of 10 N which acts in a horizontal direction.  After it moves a
distance of 0.40 m how much work has been done on the block by the external force?

(c) The same wooden block with a mass of .30 kg is pushed along a table with a constant
external force of 10 N which acts in a horizontal direction.  It moves a distance of 0.40 m. 
However, there is a friction force opposing its motion.  Assume that the coefficient of sliding
friction,  k, is 0.20. 

(1) According to the definitions of work done by a force and work done against a force, what
is the work associated with the external force?  Is work done by this force or against it?  Is
the work positive or negative?  Show your calculations.





 (2) According to the definitions of work, what is the work associated with the friction force? 
Is work done by the friction force or against it?  Is the work positive or negative?  Show your
calculations.





(d) Suppose you lift a 0.3 kg object through a distance of 1.0 m.

(1) What is the work associated with the force that the earth exerts on the object?  Is work
done by this force or against it?  Is the work positive or negative?  Show your calculations.



(2) What is the work associated with the external force you apply to the object?  Is work
done by this force or against it?  Is the work positive or negative?  Show your calculations.



Pulling at an Angle   What Happens When the Force and the Displacement Are Not
Along the Same Line?
Let's be more quantitative about measuring force and distance and calculating the work.  How
should work be calculated when the external force and the displacement of an object are not
in the same direction?



     Figure 3: A block sliding on a one-dimensional surface.

To investigate this, you will use a spring scale to measure the force necessary to slide a block
along the table at a constant speed.  Before you make your simple force measurements, you
should put some weights on your block so that it slides along a smooth surface at a constant
velocity even when it is being pulled with a force that is 45 degrees from the horizontal.


Activity 4: Calculating Work
(a) Hold a spring scale horizontal to the table and use it to pull the block a distance of 0.5
meters along the horizontal surface in such a way that the block moves at a constant speed. 
Record the force in newtons and the distance in meters in the space below and calculate the
work done on the block in joules.  (Note that there is a special unit for work   the joule or J
for short.  One joule is equal to one newton times one meter, i.e. J = N.m)




(b) Repeat the measurement, only this time pull on the block at a 45  angle with respect to
the horizontal.  Pull the block at about the same speed.  Is the force needed larger or smaller
than you measured in part (a)?




(c) Assuming that the actual physical work done in part (b) is the same as the physical work
done in part (a) above, how could you enhance the mathematical definition of work so that
the forces measured in part (b) could be used to calculate work?  In other words, use your
data to postulate a mathematical equation that relates the physical work, W, to the magnitude
of the applied force, F, the magnitude of the displacement,  s, and the angle, q, between F and
Ds. Explain your reasoning.  Hint: sin 30  = .500, sin 45  = .707, cos 30  = .865, cos 45  =
.707.





 
Work as a Dot Product
Review the definition of dot (or scalar) product as a special product of two vectors in your
textbook, and convince yourself that the dot product can be used to define physical work in
general cases when the force is constant but not necessarily in the direction of the
displacement resulting from it.
                         W = F   s                    [Equation 3]

Activity 5: How Much Work Goes with Each Job?
(a) Re-examine the descriptions of the jobs shown in Figure 1.  What is the minimum
physical work done in job 1?





(b) What is the minimum physical work done in job 2?





(c) What is the minimum physical work is done in job 3?





(d) Was your original intuition about which job to take correct?  Which job should Richmond
Load 'n' Go try to land?

The Concept of Power
People are interested in more than physical work.  They are also interested in the rate at
which physical work can be done.  Average power, <P>, is defined as the ratio of the amount
of work done, DW, to the time interval, Dt, it takes to do the work, so that

                         

Instantaneous power is given by the derivative of work with respect to time, or

                                   [Equation 4]

If work is measured in joules and time in seconds then the fundamental unit of power is in
joules/second where 1 joule/second equals one watt.  However, a more traditional unit of
power is the horsepower, which represents the rate at which a typical work horse can do
physical work.  It turns out that 1 horsepower (or hp) = 746 watts = 746 joules/second.

Those of you who are car buffs know that horsepower is a big deal in rating high
performance cars.  The hp in a souped-up car is in the hundreds.  How does your stair
climbing ability stack up?  Let's see how long it takes you to climb the three stories of stairs
in the science center.

Activity 6: Rate the Horsepower in Your Legs
(a)  Determine the time it takes you to climb the three flights of stairs in the science center. 
Then measure the height of the climb and compute the work done against the force of gravity.


 




(b) Compute the average power, <P>, you expended in hp.  How does this compare to the
horsepower of your favorite automobile?  If you're not into cars, how do you stack up against
a horse?

\textbf{Objective} 

To understand the relationship between the direction of the force applied to
an object and the direction of the acceleration of the object. 

\textbf{Overview} 

In the previous lab you examined the one-dimensional motions of an object caused
by a single force applied to the object. You have seen that when friction is
so small that it can be ignored, a single constant applied force will cause
an object to have a constant acceleration. (The object will speed up at a steady
rate.) 

Under these conditions, you have seen that the acceleration is proportional
to the applied force, if the mass of the object is not changed. You saw that
when a constant force is applied to a cart, the cart speeds up at a constant
rate so that it has a constant acceleration. If the applied force is made larger,
then the acceleration is proportionally larger. This allows you to define force
more precisely not just in terms of the stretches of rubber bands and springs,
but as the entity (the ``thing'') that causes acceleration.

The goal of this lab is to continue to develop the relationship between force
and acceleration, an important part of the first two of Newton's famous laws
of motion. You will explore motions in which the applied force (and hence the
acceleration of the object) is in a different direction than the object's velocity.
In this case the object is slowing down in the sense that its speed is decreasing.

\textbf{Apparatus }

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Capstone} software (\filename{V\_A\_F\_Graphs.cap} experiment file)
\item CS2000 compact scale
\item Dynamics track
\item Hanging masses
\item Pulley with clamp
\item String
\item Wireless smart cart
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Speeding Up and Slowing Down }

So far you have looked at cases where the velocity, force and acceleration all
have the same sign (all positive). That is, the vectors representing each of
these three vector quantities all point in the same direction. For example,
if the cart is moving toward the right and a force is exerted toward the right,
then the cart will speed up. Thus the acceleration is also toward the right.
The three vectors can be represented as:

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics[height=0.7in]{force2/force2_fig1_new.pdf} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

If the positive direction is toward the right, then you could also say that
the velocity, acceleration and also force are all positive. In this investigation,
you will examine the vectors representing velocity, force and acceleration for
other motions of the cart. This will be an extension of your earlier observations
of changing motion.

\textbf{Activity 1: Slowing Down} 

Set up the pulley, cart, and string as shown in the figure below. Now, if you give the cart a push away from the pulley, it will slow down after it is released. In this activity you will examine the acceleration and the applied force.

\vspace{0.3cm}

%{\par\centering \includegraphics{force2/cart_and_detectors.pdf} \par}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{force2/cart_and_pulley.pdf} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

(a) Suppose that you give the cart a push away from the pulley and release it. Draw on the diagram below vectors which might represent the velocity, force and acceleration of the cart at each time after it is released and is moving away from the pulley. Be sure to mark your arrows with \( {\vec v} \), \( {\vec a} \), or \( {\vec F} \)
as appropriate.

\vspace{0.3cm}
{\par\centering \includegraphics{force2/carts_slowing.pdf} \par}
\vspace{0.3cm}

(b) If the positive direction is to the right, what are the signs of the velocity, force and acceleration after the cart is released and is moving toward
the right?
\vspace{10mm}

(c) To test your predictions: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the file \filename{V\_A\_F\_Graphs.cap} in the \filename{\coursefolder} folder. Turn on the cart at your station and connect it to the computer via Bluetooth. At the beginning of each experiment, the measurements from the built-in acceleration and forces sensors may not be zero when the acceleration or force is actually zero. To tare the sensors, select the desired sensor (either the \textbf{Smart Cart Acceleration Sensor} or the \textbf{Smart Cart Force Sensor}) in the \textbf{Controls} palette and then click \textbf{Zero Sensor Now}. When taring the sensors, the cart should be at rest and there should be no applied force on the hook.

%\item Calibrate the force probe (see \textit{Calibrating Force Sensors} in \textbf{Appendix \ref{capstone}: Capstone}).
%\textbf{NOTE:} 
%The force sensor and motion detector are looking in opposite directions in 
%this experiment, so when calibrating the force sensor, set the 2nd calibration point to $-1.96$ 
%newtons, so that the force and acceleration will have the same sign.
\item By default, the $x$-axis printed on the top of the cart defines the positive direction for the cart's built-in sensors. Therefore, by default, the positive direction points towards the pulley (or to the left in the figure above). To change this, so that the positive direction points away from the pulley (or to the right), select \textbf{Hardware Setup} in the \textbf{Tools} palette. To change the sign of the cart's velocity and acceleration measurements, select the \textbf{Properties} icon (the gear symbol) in the \textbf{Smart Cart Position Sensor} window and then select the \textbf{Change Sign} checkbox. To change the sign of the cart's built-in force sensor, select the \textbf{Properties} icon in the \textbf{Smart Cart Force Sensor} window and select the \textbf{Change Sign} checkbox. 

\item Hang a 50-g mass from the end of the string.
 
\item Click the \textbf{Record} button. Then, give the cart a short push away from the pulley and let it go. Stop the cart before it reverses its direction. Repeat until you get a good run. 

\item Sketch your velocity, acceleration and force graphs on the axes below. 
%Label the time scale on these axes. 
Indicate with an arrow the time when the push
stopped.

(h) After you released the cart, was the force applied by the falling mass constant,
increasing or decreasing?  Why is this kind of force necessary to cause
the observed motion of the cart?
\answerspace{25mm}

\textbf{Activity 2: Speeding Up Toward the Motion Detector }

Using the same setup as in the last activity, you can start with the cart at
the opposite end of the table from the pulley and release it from rest.
It will then be accelerated toward the pulley as a result of the force
applied by the falling mass.

(a) Suppose that you release the cart from rest and let it move toward the pulley. Draw on the diagram below vectors which might represent the velocity,
force and acceleration of the cart at each time after it is released and is
moving toward the left. Be sure to mark your arrows with $\vec{v}$, $\vec{a}$,
or $\vec{F}$ as appropriate.

(b) What are the signs of the velocity, force and acceleration after the cart
is released and is moving toward the pulley? (The positive direction
is toward the right.)

(c) Test your predictions. Use a hanging mass of 50 g. Start recording data and release the cart from rest as far away from the pulley as possible. Catch the cart before it hits the end of the track. Repeat until you get a good run. Sketch your graphs on the axes in the previous activity with dashed lines.

%\pagebreak[2]
(d) Which of the signs -- velocity, force and/or acceleration -- are the same as
in the previous activity (where the cart was slowing down and moving away), and
which are different? Explain any differences in terms of the differences in
the motion of the cart.
\answerspace{25mm}

velocity, force and acceleration for the cart at the same instant in time. Do
these agree with your predictions? If not, can you now explain the directions
of the vectors?
\answerspace{30mm}

(f) Write down a simple rule in words which describes the relationship between
the direction of the applied force and the direction of the acceleration for
any motion of the cart.
\answerspace{25mm}

(g) Is the direction of the velocity always the same as the direction of the
force? Is the direction of the acceleration always the same as the direction
of the force?
